# Multi Byte Char Decoding

This is not anything really useful except for learning a little about multi byte chars encoding. It helped me a lot to understand multi byte chars encoding "under the hood". It is being shared in hopes it might help others as well.

Just a small piece of C code playing around with multi byte char decoding using a parse logic.

Information on the subject was obtained from a (really short) summary about the matter found here: https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.4.0/photon/prog_guide/utfencode.html
